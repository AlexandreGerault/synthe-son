## How to use this file ?

Indeed, this file has been coded using [Java's Cool](http://javascool.gforge.inria.fr/) and the [syntheSons' proglet](http://javascool.gforge.inria.fr/index.php?page=proglets&action=show&id=syntheSons).
This is the reason why we recommand you to use [the tool provided by Java's Cool](http://javascool.gforge.inria.fr/v4/?page=run) rather than try to use it in an IDE like Eclipse.
